# Hi I'm Sam 🤙️

---

I’m a full stack developer located in south Florida. 🐊 My primary stack is Ruby on Rails with React. While I would categorize my skills and aspirations as being biased towards the back end I love to style the front end as well using SCSS. I try to stay busy and I'm constantly learning about new technologies. I'm passionate about solving problems with code and creating tools that provide value. Im a dedicated life-long learner and I see every roadblock as an opportunity to increase my knowledge and capabilities.
